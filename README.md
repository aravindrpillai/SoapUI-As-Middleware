If you encounter difficulties with certificate issues and lack the required certificate for connecting to an API, an alternative approach is to channel the connection through SOAPUI, which internally manages the certificates. The process involves creating a mock service for the authentic API and linking it to our application. Subsequently, the requests originating from our application are directed to the authentic API using a Groovy script, and the ensuing response from the API is then transmitted back to our application. In essence, SOAP UI serves as an intermediary in this scenario.
